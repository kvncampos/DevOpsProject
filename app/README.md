# Simple Key-Value browser app

This is a very simple (and bad!) key-value store app. It integrates with our
simple key-value API.

## Run

`npm run start`

## Build

Edit `src/config.json` to set the URL of the API, then build!

`npm run build`

The built HTML and Javascript artifacts will be in the `build/` directory.
